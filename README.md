# Custom Conduit

This repository contains a list of different Conduit pipelines I often use when testing [Conduit](https://github.com/ConduitIO/conduit).

> [!TIP]
> These pipelines assume the services that depend on are runnning already. You can utilize the [Docker containers](https://github.com/raulb/docker-containers) repository to help you with that.
